# Homework
On your final project board, make blinky for yourself. Then add a button to turn the LED on and off. Bonus points for making the button cause an interrupt. Triple bonus points for debouncing the button signal.

- What are the hardware registers that cause the LED to turn on and off? (From the processor manual, don’t worry about initialization.)
GPIO_PIN_9 (0x80001e4)


- What are the registers that you read in order to find out the state of the button?



- Can you read the register directly and see the button change in a debugger or by printing out thes value of the memory at the register’s address?
